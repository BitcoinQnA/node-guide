### Why run a node?

A node is a computer that runs the Bitcoin software. Your node is your own version of the Bitcoin blockchain and ruleset. Think of it as your own gateway to the Bitcoin ecosystem. It broadcasts transactions, verifies the bitcoin you receive are legitimate and maintains your privacy by allowing you to participate without reliance on anyone. When you connect your wallet to your node, you are not trusting anyone else to verify your transactions. A helps to protect your from bad actors and it also keeps the network decentralised. If you do not have your own, you are trusting in someone else's node to tell you how much bitcoin you have and to broadcast/receive your transactions for you.

Your node = your rules.
